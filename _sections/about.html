<p align="justify">Our goal is to equip you as best as we can for the challenges that will inevitably come. But, perhaps more importantly, we want to help you proactively achieve the life changes that you desire. We want for you to be so well prepared mentally that you can confidently pursue change and enjoy the highs of life while being resilient enough to withstand the trials and endure the impending lows.<br><br>

We follow a few key principles:<br><br>
1. We don't have all the answers - because no one does. What works in one person's life won't necessarily work for yours, and vice versa. Our hope is that by sharing our experiences and courageously communicating with each other we can make more tools, options, perspectives, and support available to you so that you are ready and equipped for the difficulties of life.<br><br>
2. You are not broken - we are not here to fix you. You are whole and you are complete just as you are. We believe that many difficulties that we have with our beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors stem from a lack of mental fitness. As we said, EVERYONE shares these struggles in some capacity. But, ignorance is a lousy excuse for lacking something that you can take responsibility for and exercise on a regular basis.<br><br>
3. Happiness is not the ultimate goal - happiness is only one part of the whole. Everyone wants to be happy. Everyone should work towards being happy. However, setting your ultimate goal as a life without struggles and negativity is na√Øve. Difficulties and challenges are an inescapable part of life. In fact, we would argue that they are vital for growth and the development of genuine gratitude and appreciation. We are not here to make sure that you're happy. We're here to help you be ready for when you are not.<br><br>
4. We grow together - we are committed to a lifelong pursuit of the improvement of mental fitness. As we said in principle #1, we don't have all the answers and we never will. But, we will never stop seeking more answers and deepening our understanding of ourselves so that we can better serve the community. There are no masters here.<br><br>
	
We'll continue to write blog posts on mental fitness and many related topics. We're also working on a toolset and a process for improvement so that you can actively work towards the change that you want for yourself and your life. We'll continually look for ways to expand the community through social media and podcasts and invite you to add your comments, feedback, and reflections to the conversations and the community.</p>
