I was popular in high school. Vice President of Extracurricular Affairs, Most Spirited superlative, and prom king. I even earned the title of "THE Chris Batu" in other schools in the county. I was friends with jocks, nerds, and thespians alike.  

If you knew me back then you'd never believe that I had an issue with self-esteem and self confidence.

How could I possibly have felt lonely? I was surrounded by people that cared about me and appreciated me: family, students, teachers, even guidance counselors.

But I did. 

I struggled with feeling like I wasn't enough. I compared myself to friends who did better in school, who I thought looked better than me, who were more physically fit than me.

I had created this image of a person that didn't exist and when I compared myself to him, I was never enough. I took all of the best qualities of the people around me, merged them into this ideal vision of a young teenage man and couldn't stop asking myself, "why am I not like that?"

It all came to a head on a trip to the Philippines with my family.

My parents were talking with my aunts and uncles and all I heard was them talking about my older brother and everything he had achieved. I'm sure it wasn't true, but what I remember was that I thought they hadn't said a word about me and anything I had done.

I got so angry. I yelled and I cried to my parents about how I felt like they didn't care about me. It felt like I didn't matter, like I could have disappeared and no one would have noticed.

None of it was true, of course. But that didn't matter in that moment. It all felt completely and utterly true to me.

Let's be honest. We all struggle with mental and emotional challenges throughout our lives. We ALL do. If we agree that that's true, then the question becomes, why can some people overcome their struggles while others cannot?

Do they have more problems? Are their problems coming in batches which multiplies their impact?

Are their issues so severe that there just can't possibly be a way out?

Reflecting on our personal struggles presents an interesting dichotomy. While we each have to combat our own brand of unique mental and emotional challenges, we can also say that this is a universally common battle: the individual against himself.

Mental Might's mission is to help you enhance your mental fitness by helping you shape your mindset, attitude, and belief system so that you can live a balanced, more enjoyable, and more fulfilling life.

Our goal is to equip you as best as we can for the challenges that will inevitably come. But, perhaps more importantly, we want to help you proactively achieve the life changes that you desire. We want for you to be so well prepared mentally that you can confidently pursue change and enjoy the highs of life while being resilient enough to withstand the trials and endure the impending lows.

We follow a few key principles:<br><br>
	1. We don't have all the answers - because no one does. What works in one person's life won't necessarily work for yours, and vice versa. Our hope is that by sharing our experiences and courageously communicating with each other we can make more tools, options, perspectives, and support available to you so that you are ready and equipped for the difficulties of life.<br><br>
	2. You are not broken - we are not here to fix you. You are whole and you are complete just as you are. We believe that many difficulties that we have with our beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors stem from a lack of mental fitness. As we said, EVERYONE shares these struggles in some capacity. But, ignorance is a lousy excuse for lacking something that you can take responsibility for and exercise on a regular basis.<br><br>
	3. Happiness is not the ultimate goal - happiness is only one part of the whole. Everyone wants to be happy. Everyone should work towards being happy. However, setting your ultimate goal as a life without struggles and negativity is na√Øve. Difficulties and challenges are an inescapable part of life. In fact, we would argue that they are vital for growth and the development of genuine gratitude and appreciation. We are not here to make sure that you're happy. We're here to help you be ready for when you are not.<br><br>
	4. We grow together - we are committed to a lifelong pursuit of the improvement of mental fitness. As we said in principle #1, we don't have all the answers and we never will. But, we will never stop seeking more answers and deepening our understanding of ourselves so that we can better serve the community. There are no masters here.

We'll continue to write blog posts on mental fitness and many related topics. We're also working on a toolset and a process for improvement so that you can actively work towards the change that you want for yourself and your life. We'll continually look for ways to expand the community through social media and podcasts and invite you to add your comments, feedback, and reflections to the conversations and the community.

We are excited to launch this and can't wait to see the successes you produce in your mind and in your life!
